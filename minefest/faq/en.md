## Where and how do I sign up for tournaments?
It depends on the tournament! Most events are first-come, first-served at the convention  when we open at 9:00am. Registration is limited for our Battle Stage tournaments, and some attendees ensure their registration by arriving before the scheduled 9:00am opening to be near the front of the line. We recommend following our social media and checking the website frequently for updates!

## I bought my tickets, do I have to buy anything else?

Short answer: no! All of our attractions are included with a general admission ticket. However, we do sell additional Minecraft merchandise and official MINEFEST merchandise at the show. We may have third party vendors at the show that charge for their services and/or attractions, but everything listed on the MINEFEST website ‘Attractions’ section is included in the $40.00 ticket price. 

## I’m desperate to meet the YouTubers; is meeting them guaranteed?

Unfortunately, no. Our YouTubers are extremely popular during the shows and are often accompanied with excessively long wait times that some attendees are not willing to wait. We recommend getting to the show as early as possible and hitting your favorite attractions right away!
