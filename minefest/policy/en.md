# Policies

*Last updated: May 9th, 2022*

## REFUND POLICY:
All ticket sales are final and refunds are only available to those that include our no-questions-asked Ticket Protection at checkout when purchasing tickets. In the event Minefest is canceled without reschedule, you will be refunded for your ticket purchase regardless of Ticket Protection status. Refund requests without the Ticket Protection add-on are unconditionally denied.

## TICKET PROTECTION:
Times, dates, and locations are subject to change. Any such change does not constitute a refund unless our no-questions-asked __TICKET PROTECTION__ add-on is purchased at checkout. Our no-questions-asked Ticket Protection ensures your ability to claim a refund in the event you are unable to attend Minefest for any reason. We HIGHLY RECOMMEND adding it to your ticket(s) if you are unsure of your commitment. Ticket Protection provides reimbursement for all ticket costs on the applicable order. Reimbursement is available up until 11:59 pm the Thursday before the scheduled event. Ticket Protection must be purchased at the time of ticket purchase only; it can not be added to an order after tickets have been purchased.

___*NOTE:___ *Ticket transfers are possible both with AND without Ticket Protection and are available up until the first day of the scheduled event.*

## ADMINISTRATIVE POLICY:
Minefest is a kid-friendly, fun-focused event that prioritizes the safety and well-being of its attendees. Minefest employees and all on-site security personnel reserve the right to remove any attendee for any reason. Minefest requires all attendees to behave in a respectful and responsible manner, and warnings will be given if said behavior is deemed unacceptable. Certain actions will result in immediate removal from the premises: physical and/or verbal aggression, entering the event with a weapon of any kind, etc. Expulsion from Minefest is at the discretion of the staff and expelled attendees are not eligible for readmission.
