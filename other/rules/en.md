# **CompMC Rules**
*Last updated: June 7th, 2020*


1. Maintain respectful and friendly behavior across all of our services (discord, website, and social media). Keep everything rated Y at a minimum, PG at the maximum as we want to have an environment for all ages. Toxicity will not be tolerated under any circumstance. Use common sense. Anything inappropriate (images, spam, media, or other content) on our discord is strictly prohibited. Attempting to privately target users with such content will result in a permanent removal from all services.

2. Do not accusate other players of cheating or of rule-breaking publicly. Instead, try privately getting into contact with our staff members to ensure your accusations can be validated.

3. Follow staff instructions. They are here to help and ensure players have an enjoyable experience on our services.

4. Do not hack or make use of any tools which give you an unfair advantage over vanilla users.  The following tools are expressly allowed:

	1. ToggleSprint (but not ToggleSneak)

	2. Optifine

	4. Game clients such as Badlion Client, LabyMod, Lunar Client, OCMC, 5Zig, Cosmic Client, PvP Loungeâ€¦

5. "One physical movement of a body part = one single press of a button = one single in-game action (i.e. a single click)" or in other words binding several keys to a single key and using macros is prohibited.

6. Do not attempt to harm or bring down any of our services.  Do not exploit any bugs; instead, report them to a staff member.
